## Draggable Elements App - TarkinSoft

### Overview
The Draggable Elements App is a versatile GUI tool developed to provide an intuitive and interactive way for users to dynamically position elements within a graphical interface. Built with Python using the customtkinter and tkinter libraries, this application introduces a seamless experience for manipulating UI components such as buttons, labels, and textboxes by dragging them across the window.

### Features
- **Dynamic Element Positioning:** Users can click and drag elements around the interface, adjusting their positions on the fly.
- **Customizable Elements:** The app supports different types of elements including buttons, labels, and textboxes, each with customizable text and appearance.
- **Element Release Callback:** An optional callback can be provided for each element, which is executed when the element is released after being dragged.
- **Print Element Positions:** A feature to print the current position of each element relative to the window, useful for layout debugging and design purposes.
